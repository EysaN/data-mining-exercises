"""
Store a variable row-length 2D array. Write a function that looks for a given element in each row
and returns the list of results.
a) If elements can be repeated within a row, find all occurrences. In this way the result list will
contain the number of elements found in each row.
b) If the elements are ordered within each row, you can implement the binary search algorithm. Try
to construct the recursive algorithm.
